Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) are mini languages designed for a specific problem domain. When used appropriately, DSLs can:
</div>
<ul>
<li>Simplify the overall application logic by expressing parts of it in a DSL (Rule engines is one example, but there are more)</li>
<li>Simplify deployment routines by modifying files written in the DSL (without change to application code)</li>
<li>Speed up development by equipping domain-experts with a simple way to express new behaviour without lengthy developoment cycles.</li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">
DSLs are often categorised as either "internal" or "external". An internal DSL is written in the host language, whereas external DSLs are
usually implemented by parsing text, either using regular expressions or a parser generator.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Internal DSLs are commonly used in dynamic languages, but statically typed languages are usually not suitable for internal DSLs.

This presentation will give an introduction DSLs and when you should consider using them, and will show an example of how to
implement one using one of the many parser generators for Java.
